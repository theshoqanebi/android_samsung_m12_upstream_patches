Subject: [PATCH 13/43] ARC: build: add uImage.lzma to the top-level target

[ Upstream commit f2712ec76a5433e5ec9def2bd52a95df1f96d050 ]

arch/arc/boot/Makefile supports uImage.lzma, but you cannot do
'make uImage.lzma' because the corresponding target is missing
in arch/arc/Makefile. Add it.

I also changed the assignment operator '+=' to ':=' since this is the
only place where we expect this variable to be set.
