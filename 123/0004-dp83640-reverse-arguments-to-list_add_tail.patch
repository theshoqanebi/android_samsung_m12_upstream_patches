Subject: [PATCH 04/49] dp83640: reverse arguments to list_add_tail

[ Upstream commit 865308373ed49c9fb05720d14cbf1315349b32a9 ]

In this code, it appears that phyter_clocks is a list head, based on
the previous list_for_each, and that clock->list is intended to be a
list element, given that it has just been initialized in
dp83640_clock_init.  Accordingly, switch the arguments to
list_add_tail, which takes the list head as the second argument.

Fixes: cb646e2b02b27 ("ptp: Added a clock driver for the National Semiconductor PHYTER.")
