Subject: [PATCH 104/333] sched/deadline: Fix sched_dl_global_validate()

[ Upstream commit a57415f5d1e43c3a5c5d412cd85e2792d7ed9b11 ]

When change sched_rt_{runtime, period}_us, we validate that the new
settings should at least accommodate the currently allocated -dl
bandwidth:

  sched_rt_handler()
    -->	sched_dl_bandwidth_validate()
	{
		new_bw = global_rt_runtime()/global_rt_period();

		for_each_possible_cpu(cpu) {
			dl_b = dl_bw_of(cpu);
			if (new_bw < dl_b->total_bw)    <-------
				ret = -EBUSY;
		}
	}

But under CONFIG_SMP, dl_bw is per root domain , but not per CPU,
dl_b->total_bw is the allocated bandwidth of the whole root domain.
Instead, we should compare dl_b->total_bw against "cpus*new_bw",
where 'cpus' is the number of CPUs of the root domain.

Also, below annotation(in kernel/sched/sched.h) implied implementation
only appeared in SCHED_DEADLINE v2[1], then deadline scheduler kept
evolving till got merged(v9), but the annotation remains unchanged,
meaningless and misleading, update it.

* With respect to SMP, the bandwidth is given on a per-CPU basis,
* meaning that:
*  - dl_bw (< 100%) is the bandwidth of the system (group) on each CPU;
*  - dl_total_bw array contains, in the i-eth element, the currently
*    allocated bandwidth on the i-eth CPU.
