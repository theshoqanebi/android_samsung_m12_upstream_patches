Subject: [PATCH 008/128] watchdog: reset last_hw_keepalive time at start

[ Upstream commit 982bb70517aef2225bad1d802887b733db492cc0 ]

Currently the watchdog core does not initialize the last_hw_keepalive
time during watchdog startup. This will cause the watchdog to be pinged
immediately if enough time has passed from the system boot-up time, and
some types of watchdogs like K3 RTI does not like this.

To avoid the issue, setup the last_hw_keepalive time during watchdog
startup.
