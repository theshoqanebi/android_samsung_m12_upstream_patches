Subject: [PATCH 129/132] libceph: don't omit recovery_deletes in target_copy()

commit 2f3fead62144002557f322c2a7c15e1255df0653 upstream.

Currently target_copy() is used only for sending linger pings, so
this doesn't come up, but generally omitting recovery_deletes can
result in unneeded resends (force_resend in calc_target()).

Fixes: ae78dd8139ce ("libceph: make RECOVERY_DELETES feature create a new interval")
