Subject: [PATCH 10/49] platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Switch to an allow-list for
 SW_TABLET_MODE reporting
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 8169bd3e6e193497cab781acddcff8fde5d0c416 upstream.

2 recent commits:
cfae58ed681c ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only blacklist SW_TABLET_MODE
on the 9 / "Laptop" chasis-type")
1fac39fd0316 ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Also handle tablet-mode switch on
"Detachable" and "Portable" chassis-types")

Enabled reporting of SW_TABLET_MODE on more devices since the vbtn ACPI
interface is used by the firmware on some of those devices to report this.

Testing has shown that unconditionally enabling SW_TABLET_MODE reporting
on all devices with a chassis type of 8 ("Portable") or 10 ("Notebook")
which support the VGBS method is a very bad idea.

Many of these devices are normal laptops (non 2-in-1) models with a VGBS
which always returns 0, which we translate to SW_TABLET_MODE=1. This in
turn causes userspace (libinput) to suppress events from the builtin
keyboard and touchpad, making the laptop essentially unusable.

Since the problem of wrongly reporting SW_TABLET_MODE=1 in combination
with libinput, leads to a non-usable system. Where as OTOH many people will
not even notice when SW_TABLET_MODE is not being reported, this commit
changes intel_vbtn_has_switches() to use a DMI based allow-list.

The new DMI based allow-list matches on the 31 ("Convertible") and
32 ("Detachable") chassis-types, as these clearly are 2-in-1s and
so far if they support the intel-vbtn ACPI interface they all have
properly working SW_TABLET_MODE reporting.

Besides these 2 generic matches, it also contains model specific matches
for 2-in-1 models which use a different chassis-type and which are known
to have properly working SW_TABLET_MODE reporting.

This has been tested on the following 2-in-1 devices:

Dell Venue 11 Pro 7130 vPro
HP Pavilion X2 10-p002nd
HP Stream x360 Convertible PC 11
Medion E1239T
