Subject: [PATCH 003/125] fanotify: fix ignore mask logic for events on child
 and on dir

commit 2f02fd3fa13e51713b630164f8a8e5b42de8283b upstream.

The comments in fanotify_group_event_mask() say:

  "If the event is on dir/child and this mark doesn't care about
   events on dir/child, don't send it!"

Specifically, mount and filesystem marks do not care about events
on child, but they can still specify an ignore mask for those events.
For example, a group that has:
- A mount mark with mask 0 and ignore_mask FAN_OPEN
- An inode mark on a directory with mask FAN_OPEN | FAN_OPEN_EXEC
  with flag FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD

A child file open for exec would be reported to group with the FAN_OPEN
event despite the fact that FAN_OPEN is in ignore mask of mount mark,
because the mark iteration loop skips over non-inode marks for events
on child when calculating the ignore mask.

Move ignore mask calculation to the top of the iteration loop block
before excluding marks for events on dir/child.
