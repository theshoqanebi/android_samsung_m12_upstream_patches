Subject: [PATCH 063/125] ARM: dts: Fix duovero smsc interrupt for suspend

[ Upstream commit 9cf28e41f9f768791f54ee18333239fda6927ed8 ]

While testing the recent suspend and resume regressions I noticed that
duovero can still end up losing edge gpio interrupts on runtime
suspend. This causes NFSroot easily stopping working after resume on
duovero.

Let's fix the issue by using gpio level interrupts for smsc as then
the gpio interrupt state is seen by the gpio controller on resume.

Fixes: 731b409878a3 ("ARM: dts: Configure duovero for to allow core retention during idle")
