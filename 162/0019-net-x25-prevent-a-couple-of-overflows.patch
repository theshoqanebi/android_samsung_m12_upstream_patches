Subject: [PATCH 19/32] net/x25: prevent a couple of overflows
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

[ Upstream commit 6ee50c8e262a0f0693dad264c3c99e30e6442a56 ]

The .x25_addr[] address comes from the user and is not necessarily
NUL terminated.  This leads to a couple problems.  The first problem is
that the strlen() in x25_bind() can read beyond the end of the buffer.

The second problem is more subtle and could result in memory corruption.
The call tree is:
  x25_connect()
  --> x25_write_internal()
      --> x25_addr_aton()

The .x25_addr[] buffers are copied to the "addresses" buffer from
x25_write_internal() so it will lead to stack corruption.

Verify that the strings are NUL terminated and return -EINVAL if they
are not.

Fixes: 1da177e4c3f4 ("Linux-2.6.12-rc2")
Fixes: a9288525d2ae ("X25: Dont let x25_bind use addresses containing characters")
