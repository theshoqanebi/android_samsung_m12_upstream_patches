Subject: [PATCH 22/50] f2fs: Return EOF on unaligned end of file DIO read

[ Upstream commit 20d0a107fb35f37578b919f62bd474d6d358d579 ]

Reading past end of file returns EOF for aligned reads but -EINVAL for
unaligned reads on f2fs.  While documentation is not strict about this
corner case, most filesystem returns EOF on this case, like iomap
filesystems.  This patch consolidates the behavior for f2fs, by making
it return EOF(0).

it can be verified by a read loop on a file that does a partial read
before EOF (A file that doesn't end at an aligned address).  The
following code fails on an unaligned file on f2fs, but not on
btrfs, ext4, and xfs.

  while (done < total) {
    ssize_t delta = pread(fd, buf + done, total - done, off + done);
    if (!delta)
      break;
    ...
  }

It is arguable whether filesystems should actually return EOF or
-EINVAL, but since iomap filesystems support it, and so does the
original DIO code, it seems reasonable to consolidate on that.
