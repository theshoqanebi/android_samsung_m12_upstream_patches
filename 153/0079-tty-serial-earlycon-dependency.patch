Subject: [PATCH 079/140] tty: serial: earlycon dependency

[ Upstream commit 0fb9342d06b0f667b915ba58bfefc030e534a218 ]

parse_options() in drivers/tty/serial/earlycon.c calls uart_parse_earlycon
in drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c therefore selecting SERIAL_EARLYCON
should automatically select SERIAL_CORE, otherwise will result in symbol
not found error during linking if SERIAL_CORE is not configured as builtin

Fixes: 9aac5887595b ("tty/serial: add generic serial earlycon")
