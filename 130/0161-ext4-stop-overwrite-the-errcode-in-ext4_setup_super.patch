Subject: [PATCH 161/206] ext4: stop overwrite the errcode in ext4_setup_super

[ Upstream commit 5adaccac46ea79008d7b75f47913f1a00f91d0ce ]

Now the errcode from ext4_commit_super will overwrite EROFS exists in
ext4_setup_super. Actually, no need to call ext4_commit_super since we
will return EROFS. Fix it by goto done directly.

Fixes: c89128a00838 ("ext4: handle errors on ext4_commit_super")
