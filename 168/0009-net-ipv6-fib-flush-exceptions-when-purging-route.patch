Subject: [PATCH 09/44] net: ipv6: fib: flush exceptions when purging route

[ Upstream commit d8f5c29653c3f6995e8979be5623d263e92f6b86 ]

Route removal is handled by two code paths. The main removal path is via
fib6_del_route() which will handle purging any PMTU exceptions from the
cache, removing all per-cpu copies of the DST entry used by the route, and
releasing the fib6_info struct.

The second removal location is during fib6_add_rt2node() during a route
replacement operation. This path also calls fib6_purge_rt() to handle
cleaning up the per-cpu copies of the DST entries and releasing the
fib6_info associated with the older route, but it does not flush any PMTU
exceptions that the older route had. Since the older route is removed from
the tree during the replacement, we lose any way of accessing it again.

As these lingering DSTs and the fib6_info struct are holding references to
the underlying netdevice struct as well, unregistering that device from the
kernel can never complete.
