Subject: [PATCH 114/116] ARM: dts: imx6: phycore-som: fix arm and soc minimum
 voltage
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 636b45b8efa91db05553840b6c0120d6fa6b94fa upstream.

The current set minimum voltage of 730000ÂµV seems to be wrong. I don't
know the document which specifies that but the imx6qdl datasheets says
that the minimum voltage should be 0.925V for VDD_ARM (LDO bypassed,
lowest opp) and 1.15V for VDD_SOC (LDO bypassed, lowest opp).
