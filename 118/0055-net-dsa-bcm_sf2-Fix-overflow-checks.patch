Subject: [PATCH 55/65] net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Fix overflow checks

commit d0802dc411f469569a537283b6f3833af47aece9 upstream.

Commit f949a12fd697 ("net: dsa: bcm_sf2: fix buffer overflow doing
set_rxnfc") tried to fix the some user controlled buffer overflows in
bcm_sf2_cfp_rule_set() and bcm_sf2_cfp_rule_del() but the fix was using
CFP_NUM_RULES, which while it is correct not to overflow the bitmaps, is
not representative of what the device actually supports. Correct that by
using bcm_sf2_cfp_rule_size() instead.

The latter subtracts the number of rules by 1, so change the checks from
greater than or equal to greater than accordingly.
