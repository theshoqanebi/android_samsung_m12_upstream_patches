Subject: [PATCH 085/143] btrfs: set update the uuid generation as soon as
 possible

commit 75ec1db8717a8f0a9d9c8d033e542fdaa7b73898 upstream.

In my EIO stress testing I noticed I was getting forced to rescan the
uuid tree pretty often, which was weird.  This is because my error
injection stuff would sometimes inject an error after log replay but
before we loaded the UUID tree.  If log replay committed the transaction
it wouldn't have updated the uuid tree generation, but the tree was
valid and didn't change, so there's no reason to not update the
generation here.

Fix this by setting the BTRFS_FS_UPDATE_UUID_TREE_GEN bit immediately
after reading all the fs roots if the uuid tree generation matches the
fs generation.  Then any transaction commits that happen during mount
won't screw up our uuid tree state, forcing us to do needless uuid
rescans.

Fixes: 70f801754728 ("Btrfs: check UUID tree during mount if required")
