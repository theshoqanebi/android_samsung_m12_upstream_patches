Subject: [PATCH 10/86] ceph: don't allow setlease on cephfs

[ Upstream commit 496ceaf12432b3d136dcdec48424312e71359ea7 ]

Leases don't currently work correctly on kcephfs, as they are not broken
when caps are revoked. They could eventually be implemented similarly to
how we did them in libcephfs, but for now don't allow them.

[ idryomov: no need for simple_nosetlease() in ceph_dir_fops and
  ceph_snapdir_fops ]
