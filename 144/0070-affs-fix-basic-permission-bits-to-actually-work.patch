Subject: [PATCH 70/86] affs: fix basic permission bits to actually work

commit d3a84a8d0dde4e26bc084b36ffcbdc5932ac85e2 upstream.

The basic permission bits (protection bits in AmigaOS) have been broken
in Linux' AFFS - it would only set bits, but never delete them.
Also, contrary to the documentation, the Archived bit was not handled.

Let's fix this for good, and set the bits such that Linux and classic
AmigaOS can coexist in the most peaceful manner.

Also, update the documentation to represent the current state of things.
