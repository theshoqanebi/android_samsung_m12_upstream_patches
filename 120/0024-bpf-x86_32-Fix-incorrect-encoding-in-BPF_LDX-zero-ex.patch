Subject: [PATCH 24/48] bpf, x86_32: Fix incorrect encoding in BPF_LDX
 zero-extension

commit 5fa9a98fb10380e48a398998cd36a85e4ef711d6 upstream.

The current JIT uses the following sequence to zero-extend into the
upper 32 bits of the destination register for BPF_LDX BPF_{B,H,W},
when the destination register is not on the stack:

  EMIT3(0xC7, add_1reg(0xC0, dst_hi), 0);

The problem is that C7 /0 encodes a MOV instruction that requires a 4-byte
immediate; the current code emits only 1 byte of the immediate. This
means that the first 3 bytes of the next instruction will be treated as
the rest of the immediate, breaking the stream of instructions.

This patch fixes the problem by instead emitting "xor dst_hi,dst_hi"
to clear the upper 32 bits. This fixes the problem and is more efficient
than using MOV to load a zero immediate.

This bug may not be currently triggerable as BPF_REG_AX is the only
register not stored on the stack and the verifier uses it in a limited
way, and the verifier implements a zero-extension optimization. But the
JIT should avoid emitting incorrect encodings regardless.
