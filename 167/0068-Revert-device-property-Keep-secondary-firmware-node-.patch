Subject: [PATCH 68/76] Revert "device property: Keep secondary firmware node
 secondary by type"

commit 47f4469970d8861bc06d2d4d45ac8200ff07c693 upstream.

While commit d5dcce0c414f ("device property: Keep secondary firmware
node secondary by type") describes everything correct in its commit
message, the change it made does the opposite and original commit
c15e1bdda436 ("device property: Fix the secondary firmware node handling
in set_primary_fwnode()") was fully correct.

Revert the former one here and improve documentation in the next patch.

Fixes: d5dcce0c414f ("device property: Keep secondary firmware node secondary by type")
