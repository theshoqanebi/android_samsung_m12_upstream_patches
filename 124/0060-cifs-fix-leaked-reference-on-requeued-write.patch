Subject: [PATCH 60/76] cifs: fix leaked reference on requeued write

commit a48137996063d22ffba77e077425f49873856ca5 upstream.

Failed async writes that are requeued may not clean up a refcount
on the file, which can result in a leaked open. This scenario arises
very reliably when using persistent handles and a reconnect occurs
while writing.

cifs_writev_requeue only releases the reference if the write fails
(rc != 0). The server->ops->async_writev operation will take its own
reference, so the initial reference can always be released.
