Subject: [PATCH 32/42] driver core: Fix adding device links to probing
 suppliers

commit 15cfb094160385cc0b303c4cda483caa102af654 upstream.

Currently, it is not valid to add a device link from a consumer
driver ->probe callback to a supplier that is still probing too, but
generally this is a valid use case.  For example, if the consumer has
just acquired a resource that can only be available if the supplier
is functional, adding a device link to that supplier right away
should be safe (and even desirable arguably), but device_link_add()
doesn't handle that case correctly and the initial state of the link
created by it is wrong then.

To address this problem, change the initial state of device links
added between a probing supplier and a probing consumer to
DL_STATE_CONSUMER_PROBE and update device_links_driver_bound() to
skip such links on the supplier side.

With this change, if the supplier probe completes first,
device_links_driver_bound() called for it will skip the link state
update and when it is called for the consumer, the link state will
be updated to "active".  In turn, if the consumer probe completes
first, device_links_driver_bound() called for it will change the
state of the link to "active" and when it is called for the
supplier, the link status update will be skipped.

However, in principle the supplier or consumer probe may still fail
after the link has been added, so modify device_links_no_driver() to
change device links in the "active" or "consumer probe" state to
"dormant" on the supplier side and update __device_links_no_driver()
to change the link state to "available" only if it is "consumer
probe" or "active".

Then, if the supplier probe fails first, the leftover link to the
probing consumer will become "dormant" and device_links_no_driver()
called for the consumer (when its probe fails) will clean it up.
In turn, if the consumer probe fails first, it will either drop the
link, or change its state to "available" and, in the latter case,
when device_links_no_driver() is called for the supplier, it will
update the link state to "dormant".  [If the supplier probe fails,
but the consumer probe succeeds, which should not happen as long as
the consumer driver is correct, the link still will be around, but
it will be "dormant" until the supplier is probed again.]
