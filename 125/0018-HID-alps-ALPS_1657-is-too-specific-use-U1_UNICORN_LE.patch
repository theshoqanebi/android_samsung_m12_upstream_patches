Subject: [PATCH 18/81] HID: alps: ALPS_1657 is too specific; use
 U1_UNICORN_LEGACY instead

[ Upstream commit 185af3e775b693f773d9a4b5a8c3cda69fc8ca0f ]

HID_DEVICE_ID_ALPS_1657 PID is too specific, as there are many other
ALPS hardware IDs using this particular touchpad.

Rename the identifier to HID_DEVICE_ID_ALPS_U1_UNICORN_LEGACY in order
to describe reality better.

Fixes: 640e403b1fd24 ("HID: alps: Add AUI1657 device ID")
