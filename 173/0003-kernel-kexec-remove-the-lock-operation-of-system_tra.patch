Subject: [PATCH 03/38] kernel: kexec: remove the lock operation of
 system_transition_mutex

commit 56c91a18432b631ca18438841fd1831ef756cabf upstream.

Function kernel_kexec() is called with lock system_transition_mutex
held in reboot system call. While inside kernel_kexec(), it will
acquire system_transition_mutex agin. This will lead to dead lock.

The dead lock should be easily triggered, it hasn't caused any
failure report just because the feature 'kexec jump' is almost not
used by anyone as far as I know. An inquiry can be made about who
is using 'kexec jump' and where it's used. Before that, let's simply
remove the lock operation inside CONFIG_KEXEC_JUMP ifdeffery scope.

Fixes: 55f2503c3b69 ("PM / reboot: Eliminate race between reboot and suspend")
