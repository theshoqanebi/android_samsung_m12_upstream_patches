Subject: [PATCH 20/38] ARM: imx: build suspend-imx6.S with arm instruction set

commit a88afa46b86ff461c89cc33fc3a45267fff053e8 upstream.

When the kernel is configured to use the Thumb-2 instruction set
"suspend-to-memory" fails to resume. Observed on a Colibri iMX6ULL
(i.MX 6ULL) and Apalis iMX6 (i.MX 6Q).

It looks like the CPU resumes unconditionally in ARM instruction mode
and then chokes on the presented Thumb-2 code it should execute.

Fix this by using the arm instruction set for all code in
suspend-imx6.S.
