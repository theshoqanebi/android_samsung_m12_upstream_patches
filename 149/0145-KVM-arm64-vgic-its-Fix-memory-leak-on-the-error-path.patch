Subject: [PATCH 145/240] KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Fix memory leak on the error
 path of vgic_add_lpi()

[ Upstream commit 57bdb436ce869a45881d8aa4bc5dac8e072dd2b6 ]

If we're going to fail out the vgic_add_lpi(), let's make sure the
allocated vgic_irq memory is also freed. Though it seems that both
cases are unlikely to fail.
