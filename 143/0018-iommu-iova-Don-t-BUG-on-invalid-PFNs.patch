Subject: [PATCH 018/119] iommu/iova: Don't BUG on invalid PFNs

[ Upstream commit d3e3d2be688b4b5864538de61e750721a311e4fc ]

Unlike the other instances which represent a complete loss of
consistency within the rcache mechanism itself, or a fundamental
and obvious misconfiguration by an IOMMU driver, the BUG_ON() in
iova_magazine_free_pfns() can be provoked at more or less any time
in a "spooky action-at-a-distance" manner by any old device driver
passing nonsense to dma_unmap_*() which then propagates through to
queue_iova().

Not only is this well outside the IOVA layer's control, it's also
nowhere near fatal enough to justify panicking anyway - all that
really achieves is to make debugging the offending driver more
difficult. Let's simply WARN and otherwise ignore bogus PFNs.
