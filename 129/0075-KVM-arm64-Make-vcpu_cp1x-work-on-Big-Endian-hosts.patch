Subject: [PATCH 075/264] KVM: arm64: Make vcpu_cp1x() work on Big Endian hosts

commit 3204be4109ad681523e3461ce64454c79278450a upstream.

AArch32 CP1x registers are overlayed on their AArch64 counterparts
in the vcpu struct. This leads to an interesting problem as they
are stored in their CPU-local format, and thus a CP1x register
doesn't "hit" the lower 32bit portion of the AArch64 register on
a BE host.

To workaround this unfortunate situation, introduce a bias trick
in the vcpu_cp1x() accessors which picks the correct half of the
64bit register.
