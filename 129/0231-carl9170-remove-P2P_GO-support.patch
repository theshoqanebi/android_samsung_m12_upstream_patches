Subject: [PATCH 231/264] carl9170: remove P2P_GO support
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit b14fba7ebd04082f7767a11daea7f12f3593de22 upstream.

This patch follows up on a bug-report by Frank Schäfer that
discovered P2P GO wasn't working with wpa_supplicant.
This patch removes part of the broken P2P GO support but
keeps the vif switchover code in place.
