Subject: [PATCH 244/264] dm crypt: avoid truncating the logical block size

commit 64611a15ca9da91ff532982429c44686f4593b5f upstream.

queue_limits::logical_block_size got changed from unsigned short to
unsigned int, but it was forgotten to update crypt_io_hints() to use the
new type.  Fix it.

Fixes: ad6bf88a6c19 ("block: fix an integer overflow in logical block size")
