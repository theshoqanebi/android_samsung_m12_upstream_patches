Subject: [PATCH 009/264] arch/openrisc: Fix issues with access_ok()

commit 9cb2feb4d21d97386eb25c7b67e2793efcc1e70a upstream.

The commit 594cc251fdd0 ("make 'user_access_begin()' do 'access_ok()'")
exposed incorrect implementations of access_ok() macro in several
architectures.  This change fixes 2 issues found in OpenRISC.

OpenRISC was not properly using parenthesis for arguments and also using
arguments twice.  This patch fixes those 2 issues.

I test booted this patch with v5.0-rc1 on qemu and it's working fine.
