Subject: [PATCH 047/264] ALSA: pcm: disallow linking stream to itself
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 951e2736f4b11b58dc44d41964fa17c3527d882a upstream.

Prevent SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_LINK linking stream to itself - the code
can't handle it. Fixed commit is not where bug was introduced, but
changes the context significantly.
