Subject: [PATCH 33/36] tcp_bbr: refactor bbr_target_cwnd() for general
 inflight provisioning

commit 232aa8ec3ed979d4716891540c03a806ecab0c37 upstream.

Because bbr_target_cwnd() is really a general-purpose BBR helper for
computing some volume of inflight data as a function of the estimated
BDP, refactor it into following helper functions:
- bbr_bdp()
- bbr_quantization_budget()
- bbr_inflight()
