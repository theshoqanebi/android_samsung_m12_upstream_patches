Subject: [PATCH 30/87] ACPI: button: Add DMI quirk for Medion Akoya E2228T

[ Upstream commit 7daaa06357bf7f1874b62bb1ea9d66a51d4e567e ]

The Medion Akoya E2228T's ACPI _LID implementation is quite broken,
it has the same issues as the one from the Medion Akoya E2215T:

1. For notifications it uses an ActiveLow Edge GpioInt, rather then
   an ActiveBoth one, meaning that the device is only notified when the
   lid is closed, not when it is opened.

2. Matching with this its _LID method simply always returns 0 (closed)

In order for the Linux LID code to work properly with this implementation,
the lid_init_state selection needs to be set to ACPI_BUTTON_LID_INIT_OPEN,
add a DMI quirk for this.

While working on this I also found out that the MD60### part of the model
number differs per country/batch while all of the E2215T and E2228T models
have this issue, so also remove the " MD60198" part from the E2215T quirk.
