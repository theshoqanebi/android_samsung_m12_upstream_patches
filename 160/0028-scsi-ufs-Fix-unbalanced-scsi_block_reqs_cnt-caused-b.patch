Subject: [PATCH 28/87] scsi: ufs: Fix unbalanced scsi_block_reqs_cnt caused by
 ufshcd_hold()

[ Upstream commit da3fecb0040324c08f1587e5bff1f15f36be1872 ]

The scsi_block_reqs_cnt increased in ufshcd_hold() is supposed to be
decreased back in ufshcd_ungate_work() in a paired way. However, if
specific ufshcd_hold/release sequences are met, it is possible that
scsi_block_reqs_cnt is increased twice but only one ungate work is
queued. To make sure scsi_block_reqs_cnt is handled by ufshcd_hold() and
ufshcd_ungate_work() in a paired way, increase it only if queue_work()
returns true.
